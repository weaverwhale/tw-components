# TW Component Library

This is a component library for the TripleWhale app. It is built using [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/).

By default, we export the entire Mantine libary

We then add our own components/modifications to the library where needed.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @weaverwhale/tw-components
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { Button } from "@weaverwhale/tw-components";
```
